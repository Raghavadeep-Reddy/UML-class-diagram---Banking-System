# UML-class-diagram-Banking-System
Converts a problem statement into class diagram.
## Task 1 - Problem Statement to UML Class conversion
*"Develop a **Banking System** in which customer can open account. The account has the functionality of deposit, withdraw and get balance. There are two kinds of account; Current Account and Saving Account. Each kind of accounts withdraw in different ways. The account is identified by account number."*

---
### The tasks to be performed are:
1.	Extract the main objects (entities) for above system.
2.	Find the necessary attributes and functions that need to be associated with each object (You are required to mention at most three attributes and one functions for a class).
3.	Identify the relationships between these objects.
4.	Construct a final comprehensive Class diagram showing all objects and their relationships along with their attributes and functions.

### Important things to consider:
    You have to use standard UML notations for objects, classes, and their associations.

### Note:
Besides problem statement; objects, properties, and functions of a system can also be extracted from domain knowledge. You have to consider all OOP concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, association, generalization, and specialization wherever applicable.
